/**
 * Challenge 
 * Using the JavaScript language, have the function ConvexHullPoints(strArr) 
 * take strArr which will be an array of integer coordinates that exist on a 
 * Cartesian plane in the form: (x,y). Your program should return the minimum 
 * number of points that are needed to form a convex hull around all the 
 * points. For example: if the input is ["(2,2)", "(3,1)", "(2,6)", "(0,-2)"] 
 * then your program should return 3 because only 3 points are needed to create 
 * a convex hull that encloses all the points. The input array will always 
 * contain at least 3 points. 
 * 
 * Hard challenges are worth 15 points and you are not timed for them. 
 * Sample Test Cases 
 * Input:"(2,2)", "(3,1)", "(2,6)", "(0,1)", "(2,3)", "(5,2)" 
 * 
 * Output:4 
 * 
 * 
 * Input:"(0,1)", "(3,6)", "(2,2)", "(0,7)" 
 * 
 * Output:4
