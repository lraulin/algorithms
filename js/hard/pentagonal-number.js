/**
 * Challenge 
 * Using the JavaScript language, have the function PentagonalNumber(num) read 
 * num which will be a positive integer and determine how many dots exist in a 
 * pentagonal shape around a center dot on the Nth iteration. For example, in 
 * the image below you can see that on the first iteration there is only a 
 * single dot, on the second iteration there are 6 dots, on the third there are 
 * 16 dots, and on the fourth there are 31 dots. 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Your program should return the number of dots that exist in the whole 
 * pentagon on the Nth iteration. 
 * 
 * Hard challenges are worth 15 points and you are not timed for them. 
 * Sample Test Cases 
 * Input:2 
 * 
 * Output:6
