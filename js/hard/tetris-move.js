/**
 * Challenge 
 * Using the JavaScript language, have the function TetrisMove(strArr) take 
 * strArr parameter being passed which will be an array containing one letter 
 * followed by 12 numbers representing a Tetris piece followed by the fill 
 * levels for the 12 columns of the board. Calculate the greatest number of 
 * horizontal lines that can be completed when the piece arrives at the bottom 
 * assuming it is dropped immediately after being rotated and moved 
 * horizontally from the top. Tricky combinations of vertical and horizontal 
 * movements are excluded. The piece types are represented by capital letters. 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * For example, with an input of 
 * ["L","3","4","4","5","6","2","0","6","5","3","6","6"], the board will look 
 * something like this: 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Your result should be 3 because the L piece can be rotated and dropped in 
 * column 6-7 which will complete 3 full rows of blocks. 
 * 
 * Hard challenges are worth 15 points and you are not timed for them. 
 * Sample Test Cases 
 * Input:"I", "2", "4", "3", "4", "5", "2", "0", "2", "2", "3", "3", "3" 
 * 
 * Output:2 
 * 
 * 
 * Input:"O", "4", "3", "2", "3", "5", "1", "0", "1", "2", "4", "3", "4" 
 * 
 * Output:0
