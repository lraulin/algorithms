/**
 * Challenge 
 * Using the JavaScript language, have the function StringZigzag(strArr) read 
 * the array of strings stored in strArr, which will contain two elements, the 
 * first some sort of string and the second element will be a number ranging 
 * from 1 to 6. The number represents how many rows to print the string on so 
 * that it forms a zig-zag pattern. For example: if strArr is ["coderbyte", 
 * "3"] then this word will look like the following if you print it in a 
 * zig-zag pattern with 3 rows: 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Your program should return the word formed by combining the characters as 
 * you iterate through each row, so for this example your program should return 
 * the string creoebtdy. 
 * Sample Test Cases 
 * Input:"cat", "5" 
 * 
 * Output:"cat" 
 * 
 * 
 * Input:"kaamvjjfl", "4" 
 * 
 * Output:"kjajfavlm"
