/**
 * Challenge 
 * Using the JavaScript language, have the function SimplePassword(str) take 
 * the str parameter being passed and determine if it passes as a valid 
 * password that follows the list of constraints: 
 * 
 * 1. It must have a capital letter. 
 * 2. It must contain at least one number. 
 * 3. It must contain a punctuation mark. 
 * 4. It cannot have the word "password" in the string. 
 * 5. It must be longer than 7 characters and shorter than 31 characters. 
 * 
 * If all the above constraints are met within the string, the your program 
 * should return the string true, otherwise your program should return the 
 * string false. For example: if str is "apple!M7" then your program should 
 * return "true". 
 * Sample Test Cases 
 * Input:"passWord123!!!!" 
 * 
 * Output:"false" 
 *
