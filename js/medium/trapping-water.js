/**
 * Challenge 
 * Using the JavaScript language, have the function TrappingWater(arr) take the 
 * array of non-negative integers stored in arr, and determine the largest 
 * amount of water that can be trapped. The numbers in the array represent the 
 * height of a building (where the width of each building is 1) and if you 
 * imagine it raining, water will be trapped between the two tallest buildings. 
 * For example: if arr is [3, 0, 0, 2, 0, 4] then this array of building 
 * heights looks like the following picture if we draw it out: 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Now if you imagine it rains and water gets trapped in this picture, then 
 * it'll look like the following (the x's represent water): 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * This is the most water that can be trapped in this picture, and if you 
 * calculate the area you get 10, so your program should return 10. 
 * Sample Test Cases 
 * Input:1, 2, 1, 2 
 * 
 * Output:1 
 * 
 * 
 * Input:0, 2, 4, 0, 2, 1, 2, 6 
 * 
 * Output:11
