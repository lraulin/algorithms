/**
 * Challenge 
 * Using the JavaScript language, have the function MinWindowSubstring(strArr) 
 * take the array of strings stored in strArr, which will contain only two 
 * strings, the first parameter being the string N and the second parameter 
 * being a string K of some characters, and your goal is to determine the 
 * smallest substring of N that contains all the characters in K. For example: 
 * if strArr is ["aaabaaddae", "aed"] then the smallest substring of N that 
 * contains the characters a, e, and d is "dae" located at the end of the 
 * string. So for this example your program should return the string dae. 
 * 
 * Another example: if strArr is ["aabdccdbcacd", "aad"] then the smallest 
 * substring of N that contains all of the characters in K is "aabd" which is 
 * located at the beginning of the string. Both parameters will be strings 
 * ranging in length from 2 to 50 characters and all of K's characters will 
 * exist somewhere in the string N. Both strings will only contains lowercase 
 * alphabetic characters. 
 * Sample Test Cases 
 * Input:"ahffaksfajeeubsne", "jefaa" 
 * 
 * Output:"aksfaje" 
 * 
 * 
 * Input:"aaffhkksemckelloe", "fhea" 
 * 
 * Output:"affhkkse"
