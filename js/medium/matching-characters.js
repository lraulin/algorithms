/**
 * Challenge 
 * Using the JavaScript language, have the function MatchingCharacters(str) 
 * take the str parameter being passed and determine the largest number of 
 * unique characters that exists between a pair of matching letters anywhere in 
 * the string. For example: if str is "ahyjakh" then there are only two pairs 
 * of matching letters, the two a's and the two h's. Between the pair of a's 
 * there are 3 unique characters: h, y, and j. Between the h's there are 4 
 * unique characters: y, j, a, and k. So for this example your program should 
 * return 4. 
 * 
 * Another example: if str is "ghececgkaem" then your program should return 5 
 * because the most unique characters exists within the farthest pair of e 
 * characters. The input string may not contain any character pairs, and in 
 * that case your program should just return 0. The input will only consist of 
 * lowercase alphabetic characters. 
 * Sample Test Cases 
 * Input:"mmmerme" 
 * 
 * Output:3 
 * 
 * 
 * Input:"abccdefghi" 
 * 
 * Output:0
