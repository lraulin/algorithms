/**
 * Challenge 
 * Using the JavaScript language, have the function HistogramArea(arr) read the 
 * array of non-negative integers stored in arr which will represent the 
 * heights of bars on a graph (where each bar width is 1), and determine the 
 * largest area underneath the entire bar graph. For example: if arr is [2, 1, 
 * 3, 4, 1] then this looks like the following bar graph: 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * You can see in the above bar graph that the largest area underneath the 
 * graph is covered by the x's. The area of that space is equal to 6 because 
 * the entire width is 2 and the maximum height is 3, therefore 2 * 3 = 6. Your 
 * program should return 6. The array will always contain at least 1 element. 
 * Sample Test Cases 
 * Input:6, 3, 1, 4, 12, 4 
 * 
 * Output:12 
 * 
 * 
 * Input:5, 6, 7, 4, 1 
 * 
 * Output:16
