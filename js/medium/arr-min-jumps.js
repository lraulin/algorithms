/**
 * Challenge 
 * Using the JavaScript language, have the function ArrayMinJumps(arr) take the 
 * array of integers stored in arr, where each integer represents the maximum 
 * number of steps that can be made from that position, and determine the least 
 * amount of jumps that can be made to reach the end of the array. For example: 
 * if arr is [1, 5, 4, 6, 9, 3, 0, 0, 1, 3] then your program should output the 
 * number 3 because you can reach the end of the array from the beginning via 
 * the following steps: 1 -> 5 -> 9 -> END or 
 * 1 -> 5 -> 6 -> END. Both of these combinations produce a series of 3 steps. 
 * And as you can see, you don't always have to take the maximum number of 
 * jumps at a specific position, you can take less jumps even though the number 
 * is higher. 
 * 
 * If it is not possible to reach the end of the array, return -1. 
 * Sample Test Cases 
 * Input:3, 4, 2, 1, 1, 100 
 * 
 * Output:2 
 * 
 * 
 * Input:1, 3, 6, 8, 2, 7, 1, 2, 1, 2, 6, 1, 2, 1, 2 
 * 
 * Output:4
