/**
 * Challenge 
 * Using the JavaScript language, have the function TreeConstructor(strArr) 
 * take the array of strings stored in strArr, which will contain pairs of 
 * integers in the following format: (i1,i2), where i1 represents a child node 
 * in a tree and the second integer i2 signifies that it is the parent of i1. 
 * For example: if strArr is ["(1,2)", "(2,4)", "(7,2)"], then this forms the 
 * following tree: 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * which you can see forms a proper binary tree. Your program should, in this 
 * case, return the string true because a valid binary tree can be formed. If a 
 * proper binary tree cannot be formed with the integer pairs, then return the 
 * string false. All of the integers within the tree will be unique, which 
 * means there can only be one node in the tree with the given integer value. 
 * Sample Test Cases 
 * Input:"(1,2)", "(2,4)", "(5,7)", "(7,2)", "(9,5)" 
 * 
 * Output:"true" 
 * 
 * 
 * Input:"(1,2)", "(3,2)", "(2,12)", "(5,2)" 
 * 
 * Output:"false"
