/**
 * Challenge 
 * Using the JavaScript language, have the function DistinctList(arr) take the 
 * array of numbers stored in arr and determine the total number of duplicate 
 * entries. For example if the input is [1, 2, 2, 2, 3] then your program 
 * should output 2 because there are two duplicates of one of the elements. 
 * Sample Test Cases 
 * Input:0,-2,-2,5,5,5 
 * 
 * Output:3 
 * 
 * 
 * Input:100,2,101,4 
 * 
 * Output:0 
 * 
 * Hint 
 * Your programming language may have a built-in set function that can create a 
 * set of unique elements out of an array. If not, you can always loop through 
 * the array and maintain a separate array of duplicate elements!
