/**
 * Challenge 
 * Using the JavaScript language, have the function CountingMinutes(str) take 
 * the str parameter being passed which will be two times (each properly 
 * formatted with a colon and am or pm) separated by a hyphen and return the 
 * total number of minutes between the two times. The time will be in a 12 hour 
 * clock format. For example: if str is 9:00am-10:00am then the output should 
 * be 60. If str is 1:00pm-11:00am the output should be 1320. 
 * Sample Test Cases 
 * Input:"12:30pm-12:00am" 
 * 
 * Output:690 
 * 
 * 
 * Input:"1:23am-1:08am" 
 * 
 * Output:1425 
 * 
 * Hint 
 * You'll first need to determine the difference in hours and minutes between 
 * the two times (converting the times into a 24-hour format might help as 
 * well) and then you can convert the hours into minutes to get a final answer 
 * in minutes.
