/**
 * Challenge 
 * Using the JavaScript language, have the function ThreePoints(strArr) read 
 * the array of strings stored in strArr which will always contain 3 elements 
 * and be in the form: ["(x1,y1)", "(x2,y2)", "(x3,y3)"]. Your goal is to first 
 * create a line formed by the first two points (that starts from the first 
 * point and moves in the direction of the second point and that stretches in 
 * both directions through the two points), and then determine what side of the 
 * line point 3 is on. The result will either be right, left, or neither. For 
 * example: if strArr is ["(1,1)", "(3,3)", "(2,0)"] then your program should 
 * return the string right because the third point lies to the right of the 
 * line formed by the first two points. 
 * Sample Test Cases 
 * Input:"(0,-3)", "(-2,0)", "(0,0)" 
 * 
 * Output:"right" 
 * 
 * 
 * Input:"(0,0)", "(0,5)", "(0,2)" 
 * 
 * Output:"neither"
