/**
 * Challenge 
 * Using the JavaScript language, have the function LongestMatrixPath(strArr) 
 * take the array of strings stored in strArr, which will be an NxM matrix of 
 * positive single-digit integers, and find the longest increasing path 
 * composed of distinct integers. When moving through the matrix, you can only 
 * go up, down, left, and right. For example: if strArr is ["345", "326", 
 * "221"], then this looks like the following matrix: 
 * 
 * 3 4 5 
 * 3 2 6 
 * 2 2 1 
 * 
 * For the input above, the longest increasing path goes from: 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 
 * 6. Your program should return the number of connections in the longest path, 
 * so therefore for this input your program should return 3. There may not 
 * necessarily always be a longest path within the matrix. 
 * Sample Test Cases 
 * Input:"12256", "56219", "43215" 
 * 
 * Output:5 
 * 
 * 
 * Input:"67", "21", "45" 
 * 
 * Output:3
