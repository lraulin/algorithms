/**
 * Challenge 
 * Using the JavaScript language, have the function MatrixSpiral(strArr) read 
 * the array of strings stored in strArr which will represent a 2D N matrix, 
 * and your program should return the elements after printing them in a 
 * clockwise, spiral order. You should return the newly formed list of elements 
 * as a string with the numbers separated by commas. For example: if strArr is 
 * "[1, 2, 3]", "[4, 5, 6]", "[7, 8, 9]" then this looks like the following 2D 
 * matrix: 
 * 
 * 1 2 3 
 * 4 5 6 
 * 7 8 9 
 * 
 * So your program should return the elements of this matrix in a clockwise, 
 * spiral order which is: 1,2,3,6,9,8,7,4,5 
 * Sample Test Cases 
 * Input:"[1, 2]", "[10, 14]" 
 * 
 * Output:"1,2,14,10" 
 * 
 * 
 * Input:"[4, 5, 6, 5]", "[1, 1, 2, 2]", "[5, 4, 2, 9]" 
 * 
 * Output:"4,5,6,5,2,9,2,4,5,1,1,2"
