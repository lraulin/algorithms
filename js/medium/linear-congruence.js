/**
 * Challenge
 * Using the JavaScript language, have the function LinearCongruence(str) read
 * the str parameter being passed which will be a linear congruence equation in
 * the form: "ax = b (mod m)" Your goal is to solve for x and return the number
 * of solutions to x. For example: if str is "32x = 8 (mod 4)" then your
 * program should return 4 because the answers to this equation can be either
 * 0, 1, 2, or 3.
 * Sample Test Cases
 * Input:"12x = 5 (mod 2)"
 *
 * Output:0
 *
 *
 * Input:"12x = 4 (mod 2)"
 *
 * Output:2
