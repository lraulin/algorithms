/**
 * Challenge 
 * Using the JavaScript language, have the function StringExpression(str) read 
 * the str parameter being passed which will contain the written out version of 
 * the numbers 0-9 and the words "minus" or "plus" and convert the expression 
 * into an actual final number written out as well. For example: if str is 
 * "foursixminustwotwoplusonezero" then this converts to "46 - 22 + 10" which 
 * evaluates to 34 and your program should return the final string threefour. 
 * If your final answer is negative it should include the word "negative." 
 * Sample Test Cases 
 * Input:"onezeropluseight" 
 * 
 * Output:"oneeight" 
 * 
 * 
 * Input:"oneminusoneone" 
 * 
 * Output:"negativeonezero"
