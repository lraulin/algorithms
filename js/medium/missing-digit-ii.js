/**
 * Challenge 
 * Using the JavaScript language, have the function MissingDigitII(str) take 
 * the str parameter, which will be a simple mathematical formula with three 
 * numbers, a single operator (+, -, *, or /) and an equal sign (=) and return 
 * the two digits that complete the equation. In two of the numbers in the 
 * equation, there will be a single ? character, and your program should 
 * determine what digits are missing and return them separated by a space. For 
 * example, if str is "38?5 * 3 = 1?595" then your program should output 6 1. 
 * 
 * The ? character will always appear in both the first number and the last 
 * number in the mathematical expression. There will always be a unique 
 * solution. 
 * Sample Test Cases 
 * Input:"56? * 106 = 5?678" 
 * 
 * Output:"3 9" 
 * 
 * 
 * Input:"18?1 + 9 = 189?" 
 * 
 * Output:"8 0"
