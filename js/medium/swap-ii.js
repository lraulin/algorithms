/**
 * Challenge 
 * Using the JavaScript language, have the function SwapII(str) take the str 
 * parameter and swap the case of each character. Then, if a letter is between 
 * two numbers (without separation), switch the places of the two numbers. For 
 * example: if str is "6Hello4 -8World, 7 yes3" the output should be 4hELLO6 
 * -8wORLD, 7 YES3. 
 * Sample Test Cases 
 * Input:"Hello -5LOL6" 
 * 
 * Output:"hELLO -6lol5" 
 * 
 * 
 * Input:"2S 6 du5d4e" 
 * 
 * Output:"2s 6 DU4D5E" 
 * 
 * Hint 
 * There might be a built-in function to swap the case of a character. Then to 
 * swap numbers that surround a character, it may help to check the characters 
 * before and after as you loop through each character in the string.
