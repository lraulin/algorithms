/**
 * Challenge 
 * Using the JavaScript language, have the function DashInsertII(str) insert 
 * dashes ('-') between each two odd numbers and insert asterisks ('*') between 
 * each two even numbers in str. For example: if str is 4546793 the output 
 * should be 454*67-9-3. Don't count zero as an odd or even number. 
 * Sample Test Cases 
 * Input:99946 
 * 
 * Output:9-9-94*6 
 * 
 * 
 * Input:56647304 
 * 
 * Output:56*6*47-304 
 * 
 * Hint 
 * A simple loop through the string may work: simply check each pair of 
 * adjacent characters to determine if something needs to be inserted between 
 * them.
