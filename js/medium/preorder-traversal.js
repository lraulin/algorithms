/**
 * Challenge 
 * Using the JavaScript language, have the function PreorderTraversal(strArr) 
 * take the array of strings stored in strArr, which will represent a binary 
 * tree with integer values in a format similar to how a binary heap is 
 * implemented with NULL nodes at any level represented with a #. Your goal is 
 * to return the pre-order traversal of the tree with the elements separated by 
 * a space. For example: if strArr is ["5", "2", "6", "1", "9", "#", "8", "#", 
 * "#", "#", "#", "4", "#"] then this tree looks like the following tree: 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * For the input above, your program should return the string 5 2 1 9 6 8 4 
 * because that is the pre-order traversal of the tree. 
 * Sample Test Cases 
 * Input:"4", "1", "5", "2", "#", "#", "#" 
 * 
 * Output:"4 1 2 5" 
 * 
 * 
 * Input:"2", "6", "#" 
 * 
 * Output:"2 6"
