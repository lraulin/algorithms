/**
 * Challenge 
 * Using the JavaScript language, have the function CharlietheDog(strArr) read 
 * the array of strings stored in strArr which will be a 4x4 matrix of the 
 * characters 'C', 'H', 'F', 'O', where C represents Charlie the dog, H 
 * represents its home, F represents dog food, and O represents and empty space 
 * in the grid. Your goal is to figure out the least amount of moves required 
 * to get Charlie to grab each piece of food in the grid by moving up, down, 
 * left, or right, and then make it home right after. Charlie cannot move onto 
 * the home before all pieces of food have been collected. For example: if 
 * strArr is ["FOOF", "OCOO", "OOOH", "FOOO"], then this looks like the 
 * following grid: 
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * For the input above, the least amount of steps where the dog can reach each 
 * piece of food, and then return home is 11 steps, so your program should 
 * return the number 11. The grid will always contain between 1 and 8 pieces of 
 * food. 
 * Sample Test Cases 
 * Input:"OOOO", "OOFF", "OCHO", "OFOO" 
 * 
 * Output:7 
 * 
 * 
 * Input:"FOOO", "OCOH", "OFOF", "OFOO" 
 * 
 * Output:10
