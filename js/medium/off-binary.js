/**
 * Challenge 
 * Using the JavaScript language, have the function OffBinary(strArr) read the 
 * array of strings stored in strArr, which will contain two elements, the 
 * first will be a positive decimal number and the second element will be a 
 * binary number. Your goal is to determine how many digits in the binary 
 * number need to be changed to represent the decimal number correctly (either 
 * 0 change to 1 or vice versa). For example: if strArr is ["56", "011000"] 
 * then your program should return 1 because only 1 digit needs to change in 
 * the binary number (the first zero needs to become a 1) to correctly 
 * represent 56 in binary. 
 * Sample Test Cases 
 * Input:"5624", "0010111111001" 
 * 
 * Output:2 
 * 
 * 
 * Input:"44", "111111" 
 * 
 * Output:3
