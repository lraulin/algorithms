/**
 * Challenge 
 * Using the JavaScript language, have the function LongestConsecutive(arr) 
 * take the array of positive integers stored in arr and return the length of 
 * the longest consecutive subsequence (LCS). An LCS is a subset of the 
 * original list where the numbers are in sorted order, from lowest to highest, 
 * and are in a consecutive, increasing order. The sequence does not need to be 
 * contiguous and there can be several different subsequences. For example: if 
 * arr is [4, 3, 8, 1, 2, 6, 100, 9] then a few consecutive sequences are [1, 
 * 2, 3, 4], and [8, 9]. For this input, your program should return 4 because 
 * that is the length of the longest consecutive subsequence. 
 * Sample Test Cases 
 * Input:6, 7, 3, 1, 100, 102, 6, 12 
 * 
 * Output:2 
 * 
 * 
 * Input:5, 6, 1, 2, 8, 9, 7 
 * 
 * Output:5
