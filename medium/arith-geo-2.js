/**Using the JavaScript language, have the function ArithGeoII(arr) take the array 
of numbers stored in arr and return the string "Arithmetic" if the sequence 
follows an arithmetic pattern or return "Geometric" if it follows a geometric 
pattern. If the sequence doesn't follow either pattern return -1. An arithmetic 
sequence is one where the difference between each of the numbers is consistent, 
where as in a geometric sequence, each term after the first is multiplied by 
some constant or common ratio. Arithmetic example: [2, 4, 6, 8] and Geometric 
example: [2, 6, 18, 54]. Negative numbers may be entered as parameters, 0 will 
not be entered, and no array will contain all the same elements.   */

  // Check if arithmetic
  let lastDiff;
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length-1; i++) {
